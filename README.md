# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map overviews

### [Browse Overviews](overviews.md)

This is a collection of radar overviews, and eventually thumbnails,
in more usable formats, with scripts for easily updating them.
The scripts use [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to convert
the raw DDS files to JPEG files.

The converting stuff should work for any DDS files to JPEG.

If you're just looking for image versions of the maps, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews/releases)
and get the latest [`overviews.zip`](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews/releases/download/4.0.0/overviews.zip)

If you'd like a different solution, you can check out [SimpleRadar](https://readtldr.gg/simpleradar).

## Updating the overviews

* Drop the `.dds` files from `common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/resource/overviews` in
`csgo-overviews/overviews/raw`.

* Run the script:

```bash
  scripts/update_overviews.sh
```
